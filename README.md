# bookie
This chatbot was built for my Voice Application class. 

Bookie is designed to streamline the student textbook purchasing process.
With the potential to integrate with the schoolâ€™s class requirements, and the school library, as well as online 
options, students can request a list of all the textbooks they need for a term and purchase them seamlessly. 
Bookie enables students to check stock availability in real-time, ensuring they know what is in stock or out of 
stock, making the textbook acquisition process efficient and hassle-free.

The application was built using [Google's Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow?hl=en). 
Everything was free and easy to use, and I would highly recommed it for a simple chatbot like this.
