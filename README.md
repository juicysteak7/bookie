This chatbot was built for my Voice Application class. 

Text interpretation is a crucial step in understanding requests in a voice application. 

Bookie is designed to streamline the student textbook purchasing process. 

With the potential to integrate with the schoolâ€™s class requirements, and the school library, as well as online 
options, students can request a list of all the textbooks they need for a term and purchase them seamlessly. 

Bookie enables students to check stock availability in real-time, ensuring they know what is in stock or out of 
stock, making the textbook acquisition process efficient and hassle-free.
